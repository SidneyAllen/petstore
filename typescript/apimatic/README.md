# APIMatic TypeScript Sample App

This project is for evaluating a TypeScript SDK generated by APIMatic. The generated client SDK code sits in the *Petstore* subfolder and was built using [APIMatic](https://www.apimatic.io). 

Our sample app code is in the *myapp* subfolder. The package.json points to our SDK folder so it can be installed as a dependency.

You can generate alternative SDKs by following the directions on sdks.io.


## Installation

Open a terminal app and change into to the "myapps" folder. 

Run this command to install the petstore SDK dependency.

``` bash
npm install
```

## Compile

In the same terminal, compile the TypeScript code into JavaScript

``` bash
tsc --build
```

## Run your app

Lastly, run the application using this command.

``` bash
node index.js
```

You should see "Hello X" with a random name returned from the API to populate the X value.
